Transitional rules on the sale of investment certificates purchased before 19 January 1994
If you sell investment certificates purchased before 19 January 1994, you may, in certain cases, be able to use the value on 19 January 1994 as the acquisition cost.
If you could sell investment certificates on 18 January 1994 without taxation, you can use the market value of the investment certificate on 19 January 1994 instead of the actual purchase price when determining the gain/loss.
If you are entitled to use the market value on 19 May 1993, you can continue to use this value.
A deductible or offsettable loss cannot be higher than the difference between the consideration and the market value of the investment certificates on 19 May 1993 and 19 January 1994.
