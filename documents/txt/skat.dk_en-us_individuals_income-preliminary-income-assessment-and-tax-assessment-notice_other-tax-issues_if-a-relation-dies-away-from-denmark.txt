If a relation dies away from Denmark
When a person with relations to Denmark dies outside Denmark, you have to follow specific procedures and certain conditions apply.
How do you report a non-Danish death certificate?
Remember to have the Danish CPR no. (civil registration no.) stated on the death certificate. And depending on whether the deceased was registered with Folkeregistret (the Danish national register of persons) or not, you have to do as follows:
If the person has been registered with an address in Folkeregisteret
:
Send the death certificate to the municipality that the person left, this means the municipality where the person lived most recently in Denmark.
If the person has never been registered with an address in Folkeregisteret
:
Send the death certificate by regular post to the Danish Tax Agency at this address:
Skattestyrelsen
Nykøbingvej 76, Bygning 45
4990 Sakskøbing
Denmark
Alternatively, you can
send it to us electronically here
