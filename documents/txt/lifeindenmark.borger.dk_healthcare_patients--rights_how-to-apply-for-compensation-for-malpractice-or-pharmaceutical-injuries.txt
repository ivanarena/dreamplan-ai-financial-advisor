How do I claim compensation?
You have the right to claim compensation if you have suffered an injury or complication after being treated at a general hospital, private hospital, or following treatment by a doctor in private practice or other authorised healthcare professionals in Denmark. You can also claim compensation if you have suffered side effects of medication.
You can make your claim to the Danish Patient Compensation Association (Patienterstatningen) who will look into your case and make a decision.
