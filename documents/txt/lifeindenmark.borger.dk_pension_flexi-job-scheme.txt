What are labour market exit benefits under the flexi job scheme?
Labour market exit benefits under the flexi job scheme (Fleksydelse) are a labour market exit benefit â€“ meaning a payment to you if you have been referred to a flexi job and you want to stop working some years before you reach the retirement age for the state-funded old-age pension.
To be eligible to receive labour market exit benefits under the flexi job scheme, you must:
have reached an age at which you are eligible to receive labour market exit benefits under the flexi job scheme
have a flexi job or have been referred to a flexi job (and have been so for at least three months)
pay contributions to the flexi job scheme
meet the requirements for seniority from the unemployment insurance fund and for paying contributions to the labour market exit benefit scheme/the flexi job scheme
have calculated your pension assets
live in Denmark or another EU/EEA country, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Switzerland or the United Kingdom.
How do I earn seniority?
To be eligible to receive labour market exit benefits under the flexi job scheme, you must have earned seniority.
As a general rule, you must have paid contributions to the labour market exit benefit scheme/the flexi job scheme for 30 years, and you must have started paying the contributions no later than from the age of 30 in order to earn the right to receive benefits under the Danish flexi job scheme.
Special rules apply if you were born before 1978 and, depending on your date of birth, you may be covered by one or more of these special rules.
