Pay outstanding tax for 2024
Your tax assessment notice for 2024 will be ready on 24 March 2025. It tells you if you'll get a tax refund or if you have paid too little tax in 2024.
The deadline for voluntary payment of outstanding tax is 1 July 2025. You an pay by means of dankort until 23:59 or via online banking within the opening hours of your online banking option.
You can read more about interest and interest surcharge below. When you pay your outstanding tax, it will be registered 2-3 working days after the day you pay. You can see your receipt in E-tax (our self-service system TastSelv) under
Betaling - Betalingshistorik
(Payment - payment history).
If you want to avoid having to pay outstanding tax in March 2025, you should check whether your preliminary income assessment for 2024 is correct.
Pay outstanding tax for 2024
If you compare your preliminary income assessment and your tax assessment notice for 2024, you can see why you have to pay outstanding tax.
Outstanding tax may be caused by:
The interest expenses in your tax assessment notice are lower than those in your preliminary income assessment (due to refinanced mortgage or sale of home, for example)
You have bought a home during the year and the property value tax is not stated in your preliminary income assessment
Holiday pay in connection with change of job (holiday pay is taxed in the year it is accrued)
You have used your primary tax card for two different jobs in the same period. You can see this from your payslips
You are missing a deduction in your tax assessment notice which you have to enter yourself (this could be deduction for transport between home and Work or travelling expenses).
Outstanding tax may also be caused by:
Your employment allowance in your tax assessment is lower than that in your preliminary income assessment (as you have stopped working or your income has been lower than expected, for example. The state education grant, unemployment, sickness and parental leave benefits (dagpenge) and pension do not entitle you to an employment allowance)
The deduction for transport between home and work in your tax assessment notice is lower than that in your preliminary income assessment
Your private pension contributions are not as high as stated in your preliminary income assessment
You have made a profit on securities

Outstanding tax up to DKK 24,786
If you pay your outstanding tax between 1 January and 1 July 2025, you will be charged interest on a daily basis at an annual rate of 5.3 % from 1 January until the day when you make the payment.
The sooner you pay, the less interest you pay. If you don’t pay your outstanding tax by 1 July 2025, the interest will change. In stead we calculate an interest charge of 7.3 % on up to DKK 24.786 which we will include in your tax for 2026.
Read the section
If you don't pay your outstanding tax
to learn what it means for your finances in 2026 if you do not make the payment by 1 July 2025.
Outstanding tax of more than DKK 24,786
Outstanding tax exceeding DKK 24.786 will be charged in 3 instalments in August, September and October 2025. You will be notified in your digital mail box when it is time to pay the first instalment.
If you register your outstanding tax for Nets direct debit service (Betalingsservice)
, the instalments will be paid automatically. Once the payment appears from your payment summary from Nets, it will be paid automatically.

Please note that you have to round off the amount when you make the payment.
We will add an interest charge of 7.3% to your outstanding tax, if you have not paid it by 1 July 2025. The total amount will be included in your tax for 2026. However, maximum DKK 24,786 including charges.
This means that your personal allowance for 2026 will be reduced and that you this way will be paying more tax in 2026.
If, for example, you have outstanding tax of DKK 15.000 in 2024 and that you don’t pay this tax, it means that in 2026 you will have to pay approx. DKK 16,095 more in tax. As a result you will get paid DKK 1,341 less each month.
It also means that you will not be finished paying your outstanding tax for 2024 until the end of 2026.

You can calculate whether you have paid too little or too much tax in 2024. However, to do so you need to know your financial situation very well as you will have to enter all relevant amounts yourself.
Calculate your tax for 2024 (currently in Danish only)
The interest rates on a daily basis and interest surcharge for 2022 were too low. The correct rates for 2022 for interest on a daily basis is 2.2% and interest surcharge is 4.2%.
This means that citizens with outstanding tax for 2022 have paid too little. We will contact anyone who will be charged the difference.
Mistakenly, we stated at our website that if you had outstanding tax for 2022 and you paid the outstanding tax before 3 July 2023, you would be 1.7% from 1 January until the day you made the payment. Likewise, we stated that you would be charged an interest surcharge of 3.7% on outstanding tax paid after 3 July 2023. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Pensioners living outside Denmark who are not liable to pay tax in Denmark may sometimes be charged outstanding tax because we calculated tax on their pension.
