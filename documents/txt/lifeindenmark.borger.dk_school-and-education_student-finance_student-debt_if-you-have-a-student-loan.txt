Paying back student loan while living outside of Denmark
Your student loan checklist: MitID,  address change and Digital Post
If you're
planning to move abroad and have a student loan to manage, there are three
essential steps you need to take to ensure everything runs smoothly.
1. Keep you MitID active
What it involves:
Keeping your
MitID active allows you to access your personal information in Denmark and
manage your student loan online.
Why it is important:
Maintaining
an active MitID ensures that you can log in to online platforms and
self-service solutions related to your loan and access important information
and services. If your MitID expires or becomes inactive, you might face
difficulties in managing your loan or accessing updates.

2. Update your address
What it involves:
When you move abroad, you need to notify the Danish Civil Registration
System (CPR) and Udbetaling Danmark of your new address. This is crucial
because it ensures that you receive all important documents and communications
related to your loan, such as payment reminders, updates, and policy changes.
Update your foreign address in the Danish Civil Registration System (CPR)
Why it's important:
If your address isn’t
updated, you might miss critical information, which could lead to missed
payments or misunderstandings about your loan status. Ensuring your address is
current helps prevent these issues and keeps you informed about any changes and
requirements.
3. Ensure you remain subscribed to Digital Post
What it involves:
Ensuring that you are subscribed to Digital Post means you will
receive important notifications and updates related to your student loan
electronically.
Why it's important:
Staying subscribed to
Digital Post ensures that you don’t miss any essential communications, such as
changes in loan terms, payment deadlines, or other critical information. It
helps you stay on top of your responsibilities even while living abroad.

student loan, please follow these guidelines to ensure your payment is

2. Payment deadline
Due date:
Ensure that your payment is received by Udbetaling Danmark no later than the 8th of each month.
3. Payment methods
From abroad:
If you are paying from a foreign bank, use
the following details:

DK88 0216 4069 2110 03 (This IBAN is
specifically for SU loan repayments.)
BIC/SWIFT Code:

If  you have difficulties making payments
Here are your options
You have 3 options if you have difficulties making payments during a given period:
Postpone your payment: You can postpone your payment for up to 2 years. You can do this in the self-service solution "Your student debt" by clicking the "Start" button at the top of this page.
Reduce your instalment: You can apply to have your instalment reduced for a period. You can do this by contacting Udbetaling Danmark.
Extend payment period: You can apply to extend the payment period. However, there are certain conditions that need to be met.
What you need to know if you want to apply to have your payment period extended
There are conditions that you must meet to apply for an extension of your payment. You must either:
Have a reduced work capacity
Receive early retirement pension
Have a flexi-job (fleksjob in Danish)
Be enrolled in a resource clarification (ressourceforløb in Danish)
You do not have the option to extend your payment period if, for example, you have a low income, are repaying multiple loans simultaneously, or are affected by inflation or rising interest rates.
What happens if you don't make any payments
If you fail to make timely payments, Udbetaling Danmark will send you 2 reminders. For each reminder, you will be charged an additional fee. If payment is still not received, your loan will be terminated, and both your payments and the interest will be higher. After that, Udbetaling Danmark will transfer your debt to the Gældsstyrelsen (Danish Debt Collection Agency) for further collection.
Interests and fees on student loan
Accrued interest affects your loan balance
Interest starts to accrue (grow) from the day your loan is disbursed until the day you have paid it back.
Student loan has a fixed interest rate of 4 percent while you are studying. Once you have completed your education, it switches to a variable interest rate for the remainder of your payment period.
The variable interest rate consists of the bank rate and an additional percentage:
The bank rate is an interest rate that is regularly set by Danmarks Nationalbank (The National Bank). As of May 1, 2025, the discount rate is 1.85 percent.
The additional percentage is currently 1 percent.
This means that you are currently paying 2.85 percent interest on your student loan once you have completed your education.
You can always check the interest rate on your student loan in the self-service solution "Your student debt" by clicking the "Start" button at the top of this page.
The interest rate on student loan is decreasing
As of May 1, 2025 the interest rate on SU loans fell to 2.85 percent.
The interest rate affects the repayment period for your student loan
When the interest rate on your student loan decreases, your monthly payment remains the same, but your repayment period becomes shorter. This means you will pay off your loan faster because a larger portion of your payment goes towards repaying the loan rather than the interest.
Conversely, when the interest rate on your student loan increases, your monthly payment also remains the same, but your repayment period becomes longer. This means it will take longer to pay off your loan because a larger portion of your payment goes towards covering the higher interest costs.
The interest rate on student loan over time
The student loan, as we know it today, was introduced in 1988. Since then, the interest rate has fluctuated significantly.
Here, you can find an overview of both current and historical interest rates on SU loans.
Interest rate changes have an impact on your payment plan
Your payment plan changes in accordance with the interest rate. If the interest rate rises, your payment period becomes longer, whereas it becomes shorter if the interest rate falls.
Therefore, the interest rate does not affect your instalment payments.
You receive deduction on your loan
You automatically get deduction for the interest on your student loan when you start paying your loan back.
You can see the deduction on your tax assessment notice on the Danish Tax Agency's website.
