Pensions from another EU or EEA country
If you take out a pension scheme in another EU or EEA country, you can apply to the Danish Tax Agency (Skattestyrelsen) to have the scheme approved.
If we have approved the pension scheme, you can obtain tax relief for your contributions under Danish rules.
Approval also means that, when you receive payments from the scheme at a future date, they will be taxed under Danish rules.
You may be entitled to tax relief or exemption for your contributions to a foreign pension scheme in an EU or EEA country if:
The Danish Tax Agency (Skattestyrelsen) has approved the scheme.
The foreign bank has been approved by the Danish Tax Agency.
You have completed a citizen's declaration.
If the conditions have been met, you can
transfer the pension scheme to approved schemes under the same rules as for schemes offered by Danish pension providers without incurring a tax liability
obtain tax relief/exemption for your Danish income under Danish rules
You have to pay:
Tax on the annual returns from the pension scheme assets at a rate of 15.3%.
Ordinary income tax or a charge if your pension is disbursed or you have it at your disposal in any other way.
