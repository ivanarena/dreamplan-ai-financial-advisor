Submit a complaint
Here you can submit a complaint to the Danish Maritime Authority about your shipowner if you are dissatisfied with your working and living conditions. This is your right as Danish seafarer or a seafarer on board a Danish flagged vessel.
Please fill out the electronic form to submit a complaint to the Danish Maritime Authority:
The Danish Maritime Authoritys electronic form for complaints under the Maritime Labour Convention
Complete confidentiality
It will be completely confidential who has submitted the complaint. The Danish Maritime Authority must not disclose the name or any personal details about the seafarer who complains without his or her consent, just as the Danish Maritime Authority must not inform whether an inspection of a ship is made due to a complaint.
Each individual shipowner is responsible that the procedures used when dealing with complaints are reasonable, fast and efficient.
