About payment of B-tax
The information stated in your preliminary income assessment is used to calculate your tax for 2025.
Your employer or pension provider, etc. withholds A-tax (tax withheld from income at source) from your income. However, B-tax (tax not withheld from income at source) may also be payable in certain cases. In such cases, instalments will be generated and it is your responsibility to pay these instalments to the Tax Agency.
If you have income such as fees or income from consultancy assignments and receive lump sums and/or other minor B-income, you have to make sure to pay B-tax on such income. You can do so by means of dankort or via your online banking.

.
Your preliminary income assessment will show if you have to pay B-tax.
You can pay B-tax by means of dankort/MoilePay or get a payment ID for your bank/online banking.
You can set up a standing order with Nets direct debit service (betalingsservice).
