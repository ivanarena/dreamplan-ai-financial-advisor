Non-Danish pension
Generally, if you live in Denmark and get paid a pension from a non-Danish pension scheme, you have to pay tax to Denmark on these payments.
However, the actual tax rate depends on whether Denmark and the relevant country have signed a double taxation agreement. The type of pension may also play a part.

Non-Danish property
If you've bought property outside Denmark, you have to pay property value tax according to the Danish rules. If you rent out the property for short periods, you have to pay tax on the rental income and on the property value for the rental period. Please note that you can claim interest expenses in your tax.
If you rent out the property for the entire year, you don't have to pay property value tax as it is then considered commercial rental.

Non-Danish assets and investments
If you have an account, shares or other securities in a non-Danish bank, you have to state it annually in your tax assessment notice. And remember to enter new investments. If you trade in cryptocurrencies, other rules may also apply.

Is your non-Danish income stated in E-tax?
In our self-service system E-tax (TastSelv) at skat.dk/english, you can see the information that we have registered about your non-Danish income.
Non-Danish income is not automatically registered in your tax assessment notice, you'll have to do that yourself - even if the information is stated in E-tax.
