Social security if you work abroad
If you are moving to Denmark but work in another EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland, you will need a decision on your social security.
As a main rule, you are covered by and will pay social security contributions to the country where you work. However, the assessment is based on your work situation.
For information about your health insurance, you need to contact your health insurance fund or the liaison body for healthcare benefits in your current country.
