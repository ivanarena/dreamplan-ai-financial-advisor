Housing tax in your tax assessment notice
Your tax assessment notice shows you your housing taxes and housing tax loans for 2024.
This is the first time that your tax assessment notice holds information about your housing tax that is calculated based on the new rules that took effect on 1 January 2024.
Step by step: This is how you see your housing tax and housing tax loans
As a home owner, you pay 2 types of housing tax: Property value tax and land tax.
It's the first time you can see your land tax in your tax assessment notice. It's still a municipal tax for, but you are no longer charged by your municipality.
See how much housing tax you paid in 2024

Go to
Property taxes
There, you can see  your
property value tax
and
land tax
for 2024
If you own several homes, you can see the taxes for each individual property in the PDF at the top of your tax assessment notice. There, you can also see how much you own of the property and the base we have used to calculate the tax.
Generally, the base of taxation is the property value tax and the land tax minus 20%, but other deductions may also be relevant.

In 2024, most home owners got a tax rebate, because of a reduction of tax rates. But in some areas property assessments increased so much that taxes also increased.
If, in 2024, your housing tax was higher than it used to be according to the past tax rules, you got a tax rebate.
See if you got a tax rebate:

If you divorced or retain undivided possession of an estate, you can assume a possible tax rebate from your former spouse.
You can't make the relevant corrections in your tax assessmet notice. Please call the Danish Property Assessment Agency (Vurderingsstyrelsen) at 72 22 16 16.
As a home owner you may have up to 3 types of housing tax loans:
Housing tax freeze loans
for possible tax increases
Loans for pensioners
for payment of land tax
Supplementary loans
if the tax rebate in your preliminary income assessment was too high.

Select
Go to payment
if you want to repay part of or all of your loan.
You will automatically be charged in relation to all loans in a property once it is sold.
The calculation of possible supplementary loans is made at the same time as the tax assessment notice is generated.
These loans are included in the tax assessment notice – in the box 'Deferred property tax' – but it may take some days before you get a notice of funding. Once you have the notice, you can see/pay the loan under 'Housing tax loans'.
Generally, home owners were notified in 2024 if they will get a supplementary loan as part of their tax assessment notice.
However, changes may have occurred prior to the release of the tax assessment notice meaning that new home owners may risk having to pay outstanding tax or getting a loan - or the fact that the loan itself has changed compared to what was stated in the notification that the home owner received.
In 2024, the minimum threshold of housing tax freeze loans was DKK 296. If your tax increase was less, you didn't get a loan to freeze housing tax increases.
There is no such minimum threshold of supplementary loans. And a result, some home owners have very small loans.
In E-tax (TastSelv) you can only see loans taken out in 2024. If you have housing tax freeze loans or loans for pensioners from 2023 or before, they are managed by your local municipality.
Please contact your local municipality if you want an overview of loans prior to 2024.

In special cases your property value tax may be reduced if the property has been temporarily uninhabitable and this is no fault of yours.
It could be due to repairs or damage by water or vandalism resulting in broken windows, or due to installation, electricity or water supply cut-offs. You can't get a reduction of property value tax if you are converting our home, building an extension or renovating your existing home unless it is done to repair such damages as described above.
Your property value tax can only be reduced if the damage has an impact on the entire home.
Register the period of the home being uninhabitable:

When you own property outside Denmark, you have to pay Danish property value tax - just as if you owned a Danish property.
The actual property value tax depends on the market value of the property. But in contrast to Danish properties, non-Danish properties are not assessed based on a public property assessment.
That's why you have to calculate the market value based on the purchase price of your property.
You are obliged to inform us of about the following on your non-Danish property:
An updated calculation of the market value
Possible rental income
Possible non-Danish property tax
Possible interest deductions
Please note
You may miss out on a tax rebate, if you don't update the market value in you tax assessment notice for 2024.
You may risk being taxed twice if you don't inform us of possible property taxes you pay outside Denmark.

In 2024, you paid housing tax based on a provisional assessment of property for 2022 (or in few cases a property assessment for 2023).
When your final property assessment is released, your housing tax for 2024 will be re-calculated and re-adjusted.
