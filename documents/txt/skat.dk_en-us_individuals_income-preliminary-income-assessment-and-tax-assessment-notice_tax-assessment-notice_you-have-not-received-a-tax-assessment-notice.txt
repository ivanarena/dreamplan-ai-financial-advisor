You have not received a tax assessment notice
There may be several reasons why you have not received your tax assessment notice. The reason could be that:
you or your spouse own a business
you have previously had your own business
you have had an income outside Denmark (for instance foreign shares or other securities)
you have previously had foreign income (but not in 2023)
you have lived abroad for some of the year
If, for example, you have your own business or income outside Denmark, you will receive a service letter in E-tax (TastSelv) and a tax return. Once you have filed your tax return, we will generate your tax assessment notice.
If you are married to a person who is required to file a tax return, you will receive a service notification in E-tax (TastSelv). You will receive your tax assessment notice when your spouse has filed his/her tax return.
If the information in your service notification is correct and you have nothing to add, you do not have to do anything further.
If you would like to make any corrections, you can enter the new amounts and click ‘Næste’ (Next) and ‘Godkend’ (Accept). Your corrections will be included in your updated tax assessment notice which is available when your spouse has filed his/her tax return.
If you have previously been self-employed and therefore received a tax return, you need to state in box 71 that you no longer have your own business and accept the figures entered in your tax return. We will generate your tax assessment notice once you have filed your tax return.
If you have had non-Danish income in the past (but not in 2023), you need to complete box 496 and accept the figures entered in you tax return. We will generate your tax assessment notice once you have filed your tax return.
If you have moved to or from Denmark during the year and your tax status has changed from full tax liability to limited tax liability or vice versa, you cannot use E-tax (TastSelv) to file your tax return that year. Instead, you need to complete one or more tax returns.
You can use the following form:
Form 04.076 Tax return with two tax liability periods
If you have also had a business and/or income from rental property, you also need to complete:
Form 04.009 Tax return for the period when you lived outside Denmark
Form 04.003 Tax return for the period when you lived in Denmark
In addition, you should complete:
Form 04.012
if you have had income or assets in another country whilst living in Denmark
Form 04.053
if you have had property in another country whilst living in Denmark
Form 04.031
if you meet the conditions for and want to apply the rules for cross-border workers for the period you lived outside Denmark.
