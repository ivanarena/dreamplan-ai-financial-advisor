Work related insurance
In Denmark, the employers are obligated to take out occupational injury insurance. You are covered by your employer’s insurance in connection with your job. Employer’s insurance does not cover your leisure time.
Unemployment insurance is, unlike in many other countries, voluntary in Denmark. You can choose to register with an unemployment insurance fund ('A-kasse').

Private insurances
In Denmark, 3 insurances are mandatory by law:
Liability insurance if you own a motor vehicle
A dog insurance if you have a dog
Insurance against fire if you own real estate.
All other private insurances are voluntary. For instance basic family insurance ('familiens basisforsikring' or 'indboforsikring') that in most cases consists of:
contents insurance covering personal property in the event of theft, fire, or water damage
personal liability insurance
legal protection, covering lawyer expenses for certain legal matters.
In addition, it can be reassuring to have a private accident insurance. In Denmark, social security is covered by the Danish state, but as a supplement there are private health insurances. Read more at the section on healthcare.
