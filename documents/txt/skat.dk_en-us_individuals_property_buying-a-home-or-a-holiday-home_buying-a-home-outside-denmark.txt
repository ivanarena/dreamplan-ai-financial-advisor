Buying a home outside Denmark
When you live in Denmark and have a holiday home or an all-year home outside Denmark, you generally have to pay property value tax in Denmark on your non-Danish property.
Please note that:
You have to register your non-Danish property with us.
You may be granted property value tax relief for tax paid outside Denmark on the value of the property.
If you rent out your non-Danish property, the same rules apply as if the property was located in Denmark.
Unfortunately, we are unable to inform you of tax matters of other countries.
Enter your non-Danish property on your tax assessment notice, box 212
