You have received several tax assessment notices
When we get new information, for example from you, your employer or your bank, we usually generate a new tax assessment notice (årsopgørelse) automatically.
A new tax assessment notice may have an impact on your tax refund or what you have to pay.
See your tax assessment notice
If you received a first tax assessment notice indicating that you are entitled to a tax refund and then receive a second tax assessment notice also indicating that you are entitled to a tax refund, both amounts will be credited to your NemKonto approximately within 12 working days unless you owe money to the authorities.
If the change means that you have to pay more tax, the date on which you receive the new tax assessment notice is critical. This also applies if you have already been credited with overpaid tax and then have to repay some of the refund.
How to pay
Month
Payment
13 March - 1 July
You can pay the outstanding tax using a credit card or online banking.
Pay tax
You can also choose to not to pay now and let us carry your outstanding tax over to the next year.
However, this does not apply if you have already received any overpaid tax, as you will then have to pay this year.
1 July to the end of the year
You must pay the tax in three instalments during the autumn. You will find the payment information in E-tax.
Find payment information
If you receive a printed tax assessment notice, it is possible that you will receive an older version of your tax assessment notice by post after making changes in E-tax. This is because it takes a few days for the post to arrive. So check the number of the tax assessment notice in the top right-hand corner (’opgør nr.’). You can always see all the versions in E-tax.
In some cases the change may not be immediately apparent from your new tax assessment notice. This is usually because there have been changes in your pension arrangements that do not affect your tax bill. Still, you will automatically receive a new tax assessment notice.
If you enter information or if your employer or bank, for example, submit information in the period of 11 March to 5 April 2024, this information will appear on your first tax assessment notice that will be generated on 5 April 2024.
You can still make changes to the version of your tax assessment notice that you see from 11 March 2024 and until 5 April 2024. Such changes replace amounts entered at an earlier date and thus generate a new tax assessment notice. Unfortunately, the earlier versions are not available if changes are made during this period.
You will be notified by email or text message about any new information added to your tax assessment in this period.
