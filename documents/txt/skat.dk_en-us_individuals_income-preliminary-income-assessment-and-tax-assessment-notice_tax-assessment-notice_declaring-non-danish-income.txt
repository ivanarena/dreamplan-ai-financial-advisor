Let us help you report your non-Danish income
Each year you have to report your income and your deductions. In some cases, you receive a tax assessment notice (årsopgørelse) automatically with the numbers and information we have received from your employer, pension provider, bank etc. In other cases you need to complete a tax return to get a correct tax assessment notice.
It's your responsibility to check that all information is included and correct.
The deadline for changing your tax assessment notice is 1 May if you have received one automatically.
If you have not received a tax assessment notice, the deadline for completing your tax return is 1 July.
You can use E-tax (TastSelv) to report most income and deductions and allowances.
Report in Danish kroner

You have to convert non-Danish currency to Danish kroner when you do your reporting. You can use the exchange rate that applied at the time of payment. If you use our currency converter, please note that we use the average exchange rate of the Danish National Bank for the relevant non-Danish currency of the income year.
See the current rate at the website of the Danish National Bank (nationalbanken.dk)
.
You are subject to full tax liability to Denmark when you live or stay in Denmark for more than 6 months (only disrupted by shorter breaks outside Denmark, including holidays). When you are subject to full tax liability and have non-Danish income, loans or property, you have to report this in your tax return (under Udlandsforhold (non-Danish tax matters)) – even if you have paid tax outside Denmark. Such matters are not automatically transferred to your tax assessment notice.

You are subject to limited tax liability to Denmark when you live away from Denmark and have Danish income subject to limited tax liability. When your tax liability is limited you don’t have to report your non-Danish income or property. In most cases, you will get a tax assessment notice stating the information we have received from your employer, your bank, etc. It’s your responsibility to check that the information is correct.
Pay special attention to your deductions
In the period you are subject to limited tax liability you may only deduct expenses related to the inome on which you are subject to limited tax liability.
There may be different rules if you are subject to the cross-border worker rules and want to apply these rules.
Boxes 51 and 53
If you are entitled to a transport deduction or a decution for travelling expenses, you have to claim it yourself in your tax assessment notice.
Box 28
If your pension or student grant (SU) is tax exempt, you enter the part of your income that is tax-free in Denmark in box 28.
Box 69
If you have been subject to limited tax liability to Denmark for part of the year, you don’t get your personal allowance automatically for this period. In box 69 in your tax assessment notice, you can select personal allowance and make an annual calculation based on your income for part of the year if you want to get the personal allowance for the period you were subject to limited tax liability to Denmark. If the limited tax liability applies to the entire year, you will get your personal allowance automatically.
Please note that certain types of income do not entitle your to a deduction.
If the cross-border worker rules apply to you, you may deduct a number of expenses. But to do so, you have to let us know that you want to apply the rules. You do that by logging on to E-tax (TastSelv) and entering the relevant information in your tax assessment notice.
This is what you do
Log on to E-tax (TastSelv)
Select Change tax assessment notice/Tax return
Click ’Vis’ (Display) next to ’Grænsegængerdata’ (Cross-border worker information).

If your tax liability to Denmark has changed during the year from full tax liability to limited tax liability or vice versa, you have two different tax liability periods in a year. When you have lived outside Denmark for part of the year and had income from Denmark you are subject to limited tax liability for that period of time. For the period you lived in Denmark you are subject to full tax liability and the principle of global income.
When you have two types of tax liability in a year, you can't use E-tax (TastSelv) to report your income. So, you have to complete one or more tax returns and send them to us via our contact form in E-tax. You select Contact -> Write to us -> Submit tax return (Send oplysningsskema) -> Tax return for non-Danish tax matters (Oplysningsskema for udlandsforhold).
The reporting deadline is 1 July.
