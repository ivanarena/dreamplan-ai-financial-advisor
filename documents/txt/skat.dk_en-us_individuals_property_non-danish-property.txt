Non-Danish property
If you own property outside Denmark, you have to Danish property value tax on it - just like when you own Danish property.
The actual property value tax depends on the market value of the property. But in contrast to Danish properties, non-Danish properties are not assessed based on a public property assessment. That's why you have to calculate the market value based on the purchase price of your property.
You have to inform us about the following on your non-Danish property:
An annually updated calculation of the market value
Possible property tax paid outside Denmark
An annually updated tax assessed value of the property
Possible interest deductions if you have a mortgage
Possible rental income
On this page you can read more about how to register the purchase of a non-Danish property and how you calculate market value. You can also get more information on the rules of rental, interest deduction and double taxation.
In some of the sections you can see who to call for further information.
When you buy property outside Denmark, you have to report it in your Danish tax assessment notice (årsopgørelse). But before you can do so, you need access to certain boxes in your assessment. See below how you get that access.
If you buy a non-Danish property in 2025, you report the market value in your tax assessment notice for 2025.
You can't calculate the market value until April 2026 as you need the price movement index for 2025 which will be available at that time.
When the index for 2025 is published, you can read about how you calculate the market value and how you report the value in your tax assessment notice for 2025 here on this page.
If you bought a non-Danish property in 2024, you report it on your tax assessment notice for 2024. But before you can do so, you need access to new boxes in your tax assessment notice before you can register you new property.

In 2024, you pay property value tax on a calculated market value as of 1 January 2022. This corresponds to the date used to assess the property tax on Danish properties.
If you have already registered a market value for your property outside Denmark, this market value is automataically transferred to your preliminary income assessment (forskudsopgørelse) for 2024. This means that all of 2024 you paid provisional tax on a calculated market value.
In your tax assessment notice (årsopgørelse) for 2024, you must re-calculate and update the market value as of 1 January 2022. The deadline is 1 July. When you have reported the new market value, it will be part of the re-calculation of your tax for 2024.
How to calculate the market value as of 1 January 2022
Your property value tax is calculated by indexing the price you paid for the property. This means that you have to convert the price on your non-Danish property by means of an index on price movement in 2021 and the year you bought the property.
The index number for 2021 is used to calculate the market value as of 1 January 2022, as in 2024 you pay tax on the value of the property at that time (date of assessment).
If you have build an extension or converted some of your property, the value of the extension or conversion will be added to the market value. The price of the extension or conversion is converted by means of index numbers in the same way as the purchase price of the property.
This is what you do:
Convert the purchase price by means of the index
Convert to Danish kroner
Round off the amount to the nearest DKK 1,000
Example: Swedish property bought for  SEK 1 million in 2017
1. Convert purchase price:
(Index number for 2021 / index number for year of purchase 2017) x purchase price
Find index number for conversion
(1,186 / 902)
x 1,000,000
= SEK 1,314,856
2. Convert to DKK:
Converted purchase price in SEK (from step 1) x Danish exchange rate for 2021
(See below how to find the exchange rate)
1,314,856 x 0.7260
= DKK 954,585
3. Round off:
Round off to nearest DKK 1,000
= DKK 955,000

If you have paid property taxes outside Denmark, you often get a tax relief in Danish property value tax for your non-Danish property.
However, you can't get a relief for land taxes, registration fees or other taxes or duties related to the transfer or financing of the property.
How to report non-Danish property tax
You must report the non-Danish property tax paid for your non-Danish property yourself.
If there are multiple owners, you should report the portion of the property tax corresponding to your ownership share. For example, if you own 50% of the property, you must report an amount equal to half of the total non-Danish property tax.
You can report your paid non-Danish property tax under 'Change tax assessment notice/tax return under Non-Danish property.
Examples of property taxes that can be deducted:
Sweden: Fastighetsavgift (for the part used by the owner as a residence)
Spain: El Impuesto sobre los Bienes Inmuebles (IBI) (for the part used by the owner as a residence)
France: Taxe foncière sur les propriétés bâties and Taxe d'habitation (for the part used by the owner as a residence)
Special rule for France
You're not required to pay Danish property value tax on a property in France if:
You have been subject to full tax liable in Denmark since 28 November 2007.
You purchased the property before 29 November 2007.
If you don't meet both conditions, the general reduction rules apply.
You can read more in Danish about the double taxation rules in the double taxation agreements at skm.dk.
Report paid non-Danish property taxes in your tax assessment notice
Please call the Danish Property Assessment Agency (Vurderingsstyrelsen) on 72 22 16 16 if you have further questions.
If you own property abroad, you must also report a tax assessed value for the property in box 491 of your tax assessment notice.
The tax assessed value is the amount you believe the property could be sold for on 1 January of the income year you are providing information for. For example, if you are changing your tax assessment notice for 2024, the value should be as of 1 January 2024.
You should only report the portion of the value that corresponds to your share of ownership.
Example:
Cash purchase price as of 1 January = DKK 1,000,000
You own 50% of the property
You must enter (50% of DKK 1,000,000) =
DKK 500,000
Remember to convert the relevant number into Danish kroner.
You can use the currency converter we provide in the tax assessment notice. Please note that you'll then get the average exchange rate for the relevant currency provided by the Danish National Bank.
If you have loans related to your property, you can deduct the interest expenses in your Danish tax assessment notice.
It is important that you enter your non-Danish interest expenses under Non-Danish property in your tax assessment notice.
However, if you rent out your non-Danish property for at least 12 months, you should instead report the interest expenses under Non-Danish business.
If you have interest expenses with a Danish mortgage credit institution related to your non-Danish property, you must move the interest expenses to be stated under Non-Danish property or Non-Danish business.
