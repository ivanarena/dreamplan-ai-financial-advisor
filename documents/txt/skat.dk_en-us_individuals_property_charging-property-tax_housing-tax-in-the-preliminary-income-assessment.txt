Housing tax in the preliminary income assessment
It's important that you correct your preliminary income assessment (forskudsopgørelse), if you buy or sell a home so that you pay the correct housing tax (property value tax and land tax) each month.
Your housing tax in 2025
In 2025, you have to pay housing tax based on a provisional assessment for 2024.
The provisional property assessment for 2022 has been adjusted according to the price movement from 2022-2024 in the property market.
See your provisional assessment for 2024 here (vurderingsportalen.dk)

Loans to freeze housing tax increases
The majority of homeowners have registered for the housing tax freeze scheme. This means that possible incresses in your land tax  will be frozen automatically by means of a loan in your preliminary income assessment for 2025.
Possible increases in your property value tax will not be frozen automatically in your preliminary income assessment. But in your preliminary income assessment you can request that your property value tax is reduced if it has increased from 2024 to 2025.
See how you request a reduction of your property value tax (vurderingsportalen.dk
)
You have to repay the loan and pay interest when you sell your home, but you can also choose to repay the entire loan or part of it before you sell your home.
