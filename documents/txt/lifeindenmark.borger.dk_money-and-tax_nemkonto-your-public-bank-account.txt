What is a NemKonto?
As a resident in Denmark, you will need to have a NemKonto assigned to be able to receive payments from Danish public authorities. This can be payments such as:
tax refunds
child subsidies
student loans
unemployment benefits
holiday allowances.
A NemKonto is a normal bank account you already own. You choose yourself which of your accounts – foreign or Danish – you want to be your NemKonto. Payments from public authorities will be transferred directly to this account.
Your NemKonto is secure
Public authorities can only transfer money to your NemKonto. They cannot withdraw money from your account or view your balance or account transactions.
You need a CPR number to establish a NemKonto
You need a Danish civil registration number (CPR number) to establish a NemKonto.
You can read more about how to get a CPR number through the International Citizen Service:

If you do not have a Danish bank account yet
If you wish to have a Danish bank account assigned as your NemKonto and do not have a Danish bank account yet, you need to contact a bank of your choice.
In Denmark, banks must offer a basic payment account to all consumers with legal residence in a country within the EU or with residence in a country which the European Union has a financial agreement with.
However, the bank can refuse to set up an account, for instance if you already have a payment account in another Danish bank.
Which documentation do I need to open an account?
Documentation requirements may vary depending on the bank. Most banks ask for:
Proof of identity (for instance passport, driving licence or health insurance card)
Employment contract or invitation letter
Tax card (not obligatory)
US citizens only: American social security card
