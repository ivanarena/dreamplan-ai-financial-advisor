Gain and loss are determined according to the average cost method
The gain is determined as the difference between the selling price of the shares sold and the average purchase price of the shares.
The average purchase price is calculated based on the purchase prices of all shares in each company before the sale.
When determining the gain, you must take into account any changes in denomination, share capital increases etc.
However, you must not include shares that can be sold tax-free according to the transitional rule on shares and investment certificates purchased before 1 January 2006 and employee shares held in custody accounts.
Example of average cost method/unchanged denomination
The purchase price of the shares sold is determined according to nominal denominations or the number of shares if all the shares had the same denomination on purchase and sale:
DKK
Purchase in 2000, nominal value of the shares = DKK 50,000 or 500 shares at DKK 100 each. Price per share = DKK 300
150,000
Purchase in 2001, nominal value of the shares = DKK 100,000 or 1,000 shares at DKK 100 each. Price per share = DKK 200
200,000
Purchase in 2006, nominal value of the shares = DKK 50,000 or 500 shares at DKK 100 each. Price per share = DKK 150
