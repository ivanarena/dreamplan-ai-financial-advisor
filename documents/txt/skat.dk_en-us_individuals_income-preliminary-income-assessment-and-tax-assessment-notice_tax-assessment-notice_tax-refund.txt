Tax refund
We refund overpaid tax to your NemKonto, starting on 15 April 2025. However, sometimes it may take longer for us to make the refund.
If, for example, you have not filed your tax return, if you are owed a considerable tax refund or if you or your spouse owe money to the public authorities, it may take longer as we need to offset your debt against any overpaid tax.
We need to ensure that offsetting against overpaid tax is effected according to the law. Therefore, we check your possible debt before we make a refund. Unfortunately, you cannot do anything to speed up our processing of your tax matters or accelerate your refund - even if you call us or pay your debt.
You or your spouse owe money to the public authorities
If you or your spouse owe money to the public authorities and your debt has been transferred for debt collection, we will consider whether your overpaid tax should be used to bring down this debt instead. Such debt could be unpaid tax from previous years, licence fee or maintenance payments.
You will be notified via Digital Post of how much we will withhold of your overpaid tax and when you will receive a possible refund. If you have not signed up for Digital Post, you will be notified by ordinary post.
Large tax refunds
We check your tax matters before we make a refund into your account. As a result, it may take a little longer.
Insufficient information
We may find that we need further information from you. Such information could be on profit on homes purchased by parents for their children, income from solar panels or profits or loss on securities Trading. You can enter information in your tax assessment notice until the deadline which is either 1 May or 1 July. You can check this deadline in E-tax (TastSelv).
Check your NemKonto
Please check your NemKonto by logging on to
nemKonto.dk
. If you have registered a specific account as your NemKonto, you can see it at
nemkonto.dk
.
If your refund is DKK 200 or less, it will be lost 3 months after we unsuccessfully tried to refund it to your NemKonto. After 3 months, we can no longer refund overpaid tax.
For overpaid tax in the income year 2024, the interest surplus is 0.6%.
If you are entitled to a tax refund, you need to have a NemKonto. It's an ordinary bank account which is registered as your NemKonto.

You may register your Danish bank account as your NemKonto in 2 ways:

Log on to nemkonto.dk and register your account as your NemKonto

Alternatively, we can register your non-Danish account as your NemKonto. But it will take about 4 months for your non-Danish NemKonto to be registered and activated for you to receive a possible tax refund.
