What do we mean by special circumstances?
Generally, it must be external matters affecting your situation which neither you nor your consultant can be held accountable for. If you or your consultant have forgotten to enter a deduction/an allowance, have misunderstood the rules or have made an incorrect entry in your records, you can't have your tax assessment notice changed.
However, the fact that you can't both deduct the wage costs for household service and home improvement services and have an income from solar cell panels or wind turbines for private homes is a valid reason for having your tax assessment notice changed.
If you haven't previously filed your tax return and we have assessed your income based on an estimate, it's not a valid reason for changing your tax assessment notice. Consequently, you can't expect to have your tax assessment changed just because you have somebody else prepare your accounts and tax return.
Income that is not stated in your tax assessment notice may be considered special circumstances.
You can have your tax assessment notice changed if:
The base, on which your tax assessment is generated, has been changed as, for example, you have been ordered to repay your state education grant (SU) or unemployment, sickness and parental leave benefits (dagpenge), or because we have approved that a compensation you already have received must be distributed differently.
You or your spouse’s tax assessment has been changed for a previous income year and it has an impact on the current income year.
A non-Danish tax authority has made a decision that has an impact on how you are taxed.
Past practice has been set aside by a court or the Tax Assessment Council (Skatterådet).
The Tax Assessment Council has reversed a decision made by a tax appeals board.
A change in the transfer sum for an asset pertaining to another person whom you have bought something from or sold something to.
