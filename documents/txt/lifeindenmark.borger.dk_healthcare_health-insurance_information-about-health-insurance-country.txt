How to submit information
Start
Start Provide information about health insurance country
You must provide information about your health insurance country if you are over 18 years of age, have moved to Denmark and:
are a citizen of an EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland
have lived resided in an EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland immediately before coming to Denmark.
If you are a Danish citizen
Even if you are a Danish citizen, you must provide information about your health insurance country if you have moved to Denmark from another EU/EEA country, Switzerland or the United Kingdom.
Why you must submit the information
The information will enable Udbetaling Danmark to determine which country is to pay when you use the Danish health service.  According to rules laid down by the EU, payment will in some cases have to be made by a country other than Denmark. This country is called your health insurance country.
If information or documentation is lacking
You must provide details about your health insurance country even if information or documentation is lacking. You must forward the documentation to Udbetaling Danmark, Kongens Vænge 8, 3400 Hillerød, Denmark.
You may be asked to provide documentation
In
some cases, you may be asked to attach documentation when you complete the
'Information about health insurance country' form.
have been posted from an EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland
are to work in another EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland
are receiving unemployment benefits from another EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland
are a foreign student
are a pensioner and only receive pension from another EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland
are receiving benefits from another EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland due to, for example, parental leave, maternity/paternity leave, sickness or early retirement.
Which documentation is needed depends on your situation and can be:
one of the European health insurance forms E 106, E 109, E 121, S072 or S1
a valid European Health Insurance Card
a decision on social security/A1 form or a refusal of an A1 form.
You must complete and submit the information even if documentation is lacking.
Scan or take a picture of the documents
Save the documentation on your
computer before you complete the form. You can, for example, scan the relevant
documents to your computer or take a picture of them with your mobile phone.
No need to submit everything
If you have both a European Health Insurance Card and a health insurance form, you only need to submit the form.
If you have one of the health insurance forms, you do not need to submit a decision on social security/A1 form.
A1 form and European health insurance forms
The A1 form is a document that indicates by which country's social security system you are covered. If you have been posted by a foreign employer to work in Denmark, you must apply for an A1 form from the authorities in your home country. If you are working in several countries, you must submit your application to Udbetaling Danmark, International Social Sikring.

More about social security cover
The European health insurance forms are issued by the health insurance authority in the country where you are covered by social security.
When may you be covered by the social security system in another Member State?
In some cases, you may be covered by another country's social security system. This means that this country must pay when you use your health insurance card, for example if you:
have been posted by an employer in an  another EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland to work in Denmark
are residing in Denmark, but working in another  EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland
are receiving unemployment benefits from another  EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland
are a foreign student
are a pensioner and only receive pension from another EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland
are receiving benefits from another EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland due to, for example, parental leave, maternity/paternity leave, sickness or early retirement.
What happens once you have provided the information?
Once you have submitted the
information, Udbetaling Danmark will determine whether you are covered by the
Danish health insurance or the health insurance in another country.
The expenses for the public
healthcare services you receive in Denmark will be covered by your health
insurance country.
Udbetaling Danmark will determine
your health insurance country based on the information and documentation you
provide. If additional documentation is needed, Udbetaling Danmark will contact
you.
Forward documentation
If you do not attach your
documentation when you fill in the information, you must forward the
documentation. Remember to write your Danish civil registration (CPR) number on
all pages.
If you have MitID, you can send
the documentation via Digital Post.
