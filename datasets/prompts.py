    To help you explore different retirement and savings scenarios, I'll simulate your future financial outlook using your personal data — just like in the example you'll see later. I'll send your details to our financial engine and give you a clear breakdown of your retirement income, savings, mortgage situation, and more.
    To get started, could you please share the following information:
        - Your age (required) 🧑
        - Your gross monthly salary (required) 💼
        - Spouse's age (if applicable) 👩‍❤️‍👨
        - Spouse's gross monthly salary 💼
        - Houses value 🏠
        - Current mortgages or housing debts 💳
        - Your current savings 💰
    Once I have this, I'll calculate your financial projection and give you a detailed summary with insights and recommendations.
    You can also ask me any financial questions you have about investments, pensions, savings, or other financial topics! 💭
    Ready when you are! 😊
