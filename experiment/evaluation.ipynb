      "rag result: In Denmark, early retirement planning involves understanding eligibility criteria such as age, seniority, citizenship, and residence requirements (Source: https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/pension/early-retirement-pension). You must meet specific conditions related to your attachment to the labor market, residency, and citizenship status. It's important to consider the timing of your contributions, potential benefits, and possible reductions due to income. You can apply for early retirement pension through Udbetaling Danmark, ensuring you fulfill all requirements and notify them of any income changes. Additionally, exploring options like deferring your pension or combining benefits can optimize your retirement income (Source: https://skat.dk/en-us/individuals/pension-and-early-retirement/tax-and-deductions-related-to-pension-and-early-retirement). Consulting with your municipality or pension providers for personalized advice is recommended.\n",

      "rag result: Spouse pensions in Denmark provide financial security for the surviving partner after one's death, often constituting a significant part of retirement planning. They ensure ongoing income for spouses or cohabitants, either through survivor benefits or lump sums, and are integrated with other pension schemes like state, labor market, and individual pensions. This coverage helps couples maintain their standard of living and plan for long-term financial stability (Sources: https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/pension/pension-scheme-for-civil-servants and https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/pension/atp-livslang-pension).\n",

      "rag result: Spouse pensions in Denmark enhance retirement security by providing a supplementary income to a surviving spouse or cohabitant after the pensioner's death, ensuring financial stability. They are paid automatically if the spouse also receives a pension, or can be claimed through registration if not. This arrangement helps couples plan their finances by offering ongoing support, reducing the risk of financial hardship for the surviving partner. Additionally, lump sum payments are available for spouses or cohabitants under certain conditions, further strengthening long-term financial planning (Sources: https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/pension/atp-livslang-pension and https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/pension/state-pension).\n",

      "rag result: In Denmark, pension payments are generally taxable, with the specific tax rules depending on the pension type and residence status. If you live in Denmark, you pay Danish tax on all pension schemes, including foreign pensions, unless a double taxation agreement applies. Foreign pensions may be taxed in Denmark or the country of residence, depending on the agreement. Tax relief and exemptions are available for certain foreign schemes if approved by the Danish Tax Agency (Skattestyrelsen). When you start receiving pension payouts, they are typically taxed at a rate of around 15.3% on the return of contributions, and the payments themselves are usually taxable unless specific exemptions apply (Sources: https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/pension/tax-on-danish-and-non-danish-pensions).\n",
